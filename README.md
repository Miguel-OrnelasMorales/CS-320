# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by assessing known vulnerabilities, implementing JUniting tests with a high percentage of coverage, and quality code review. 

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs by addressing what the system must do to achieve some goal. Next, each necessity should be backlogged, tested, and reviewed for quality. 

# How do I approach designing software?
In my experience, I avoided using pseudocode and flowchart and instead jumped immediately to coding. However, this practice is counterintuitive, and in the future, I will approach the logical aspect of designing code before development.
